    <h2> <u> History </u></h2>
    <p>
      Palakkad has a rich and diverse history, with evidence of human settlement
      dating back to the Neolithic period. The region was ruled by various
      dynasties and empires, including the Chera dynasty, the Pandya dynasty,
      and the Vijayanagara Empire. In the 14th century, the region came under
      the rule of the Zamorin of Calicut, who built a fort in the area. Later,
      in the 18th century, the region was invaded by Hyder Ali, the ruler of the
      Kingdom of Mysore, who captured the fort and made Palakkad a part of his
      empire. In 1784, the British East India Company took control of Palakkad
      after defeating Tipu Sultan, the son of Hyder Ali, in the Fourth
      Anglo-Mysore War. The British built a new fort in the area, which is now
      known as the Palakkad Fort. During the Indian Independence movement,
      Palakkad played a significant role, with several prominent leaders and
      activists from the region participating in the struggle for freedom. After
      independence, Palakkad became a part of the state of Kerala when it was
      formed in 1956. Today, Palakkad is a thriving city with a rich cultural
      heritage and a growing economy. It is known for its agricultural products,
      including rice, coconuts, and spices, as well as its tourism industry. The
      city has also made significant progress in the fields of education,
      healthcare, and infrastructure development in recent years.

    <h2> <u> Origin Of The Name Palakkad </u> </h2>
    <p>
      How Palakkad derived its name is a bit of a matter of choice since there
      are so many opinions and views tracing its etymology. According to one
      version,<b> “Pala” (barren) along with “kadu” (jungle)</b> joined together
      to give the land its name.Yet another version says that it was with
      respect to the Jain Temple of the place that led to its name, Palighat,
      since Pali is the sacred language of the Jains. Palighat subsequently gave
      way to Palakkad. The most believed version is the third one according to
      which Palakkad owes its name to the
      <b>Pala trees that once occupied its major portion</b> . As for the
      history of Palakkad goes, very little is known about it. Evidence in the
      form of relics suggests that Palakkad existed during the Paleolithic age.
      First millennium AD saw the Perumal rulers exercising their control over
      the land. This control was later disintegrated into smaller divisions by
      the Perumal governors. Accounts of William Logan, the Scottish author of
      the Malabar Manual also mentions Palakkad as one of the Malabar regions
      that was captured by the Pallavas of Kanchi. Another record describes a
      war that was fought by the king of Palakkad in 988 AD to stop the invading
      army of King of Kongunadu at Chittur. The victory of Palakkad in that war
      is still celebrated in the form of a festival. In 1757, yet another
      invasion by the Zamorins made the then Raja seek the help of Mysore ruler,
      Hyder Ali. Hyder Ali obliged and eventually secured Palakkad for himself
      and later his son, Tipu Sultan. However, with the defeat of Tipu in the
      third Anglo Mysore war of 1792, Palakkad, along with other Malabar
      territories (belonging to Tipu) passed off to the British. The British
      made Palakkad a part of the Malabar District of Madras Presidency which
      post independence became a part of the Madras state. In 1956, when Kerala
      came into existence, Palakkad became a part of it.
